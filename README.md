# Firebase ML Kit

[Firebase ML Kit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/) was introduced to us at Google I/O '18.
It is a mobile SDK that enables Android and iOS app developers to have advanced machine learning capabilities into their apps with ease.

Nowadays, machine learning has become an integral part of mobile development.
Big companies like Uber, Facebook, Microsoft etc. rely heavily on machine learning for their businesses.
It helps them to know their users better and provide them with a better experience on their apps.

So, as a mobile developer, it is important for us to integrate some kind of intelligence into our apps for a better user experience.
